# Iron Mounts

The mounts have 3 fitment options depending on the tolerances of your printer.

* Files ending in 002 have a gap of 0.02mm
* Files ending in 010 have a gap of 0.1mm
* Files ending in 020 have a gap of 0.2mm

I recommend starting with 010 or just printing all 3. The mount should be a light slip fit into the front bracket, a light drag is ideal. If you have issues getting the right fit please let me know in discord or create a post in the discussions forum in the github.
